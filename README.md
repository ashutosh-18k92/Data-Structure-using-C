# Data-Structure-using-C
I am thinking of creating a youtube channel to pubish my videos on data structure in my flavor.
So I decided to make this repository where I would host codes supporting my videos.
To do that I think I should record all the sessions and codes first then release them one by one on weekly basis.

Codes supporting the Data Structure Series in my YouTube channel
